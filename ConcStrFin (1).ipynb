    "#### Concrete mixture designs present itself as challenging because it is composed of many different variables that all consist of different elements. Concrete strength is important to the formulation and longevity of the concrete. Having the exact concrete strength will determine if it will be high or normal performance. Not performing this test can put construction companies at risk of great liability issues. Strength and durability of the concrete mix design are dependent upon the following factors: type of cement quality of all variables, ratio between water and cement which comes from the   correlation between rheological parameters and compressive strength durability and workability( Capable of being put into effective operation) \n",

    "#### Compressive strength of concrete depends on many factors such as water-cement ratio, cement strength, quality of concrete material, quality control during the production of concrete, etc. Test for compressive strength is carried out either on a cube or cylinder. Various standard codes recommend a concrete cylinder or concrete cube as the standard specimen for the test. American Society for Testing Materials ASTM C39/C39M provides Standard Test Method for Compressive Strength of Cylindrical Concrete Specimens. Compressive strength is the ability of material or structure to carry the loads on its surface without any crack or deflection. A material under compression tends to reduce the size, while in tension, size elongates."

The 8th column is how many days old the concrete is and the 9th column is its compressive strength in megapascals.
